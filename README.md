# Credits
This bot was made possible by the Team over at [Mizuumi](https://wiki.gbl.gg/w/Main_Page) for creating the API and providing the data and images.

I also want to thank Tarkus Lee and SageVarq from the Mizuumi Re-ACT Discord server for pointing me towards the API.

Finally, I would like to thank movildima on discord who have answered my queries with regards to access to mediawiki's API, and some tips on querying the API.

This project would not be possible without you and I am greatful!
